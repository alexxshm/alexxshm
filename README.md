👋 Hi, I'm @alexxshm

👀 I'm passionate about data analysis, robotics, general bot development, and automation.

🌱 Currently, I am learning Python for its versatile applications in data analysis, and I'm also delving into web development with HTML and CSS.

💡 Additionally, I am exploring ways to integrate my programming skills into robotics and automation projects.

💞️ I'm open to collaboration on projects related to data analysis, robotic applications, innovative bot development, and automation solutions.
